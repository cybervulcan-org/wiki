# Here is what I used to pass the A+ 1001 and 1002.

### [1500-page book by Mike Meyers (~$40)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1260454037)

When it comes to things I care about like privilege escalation methods, I will go through a series of blog posts until I grasp the concept. 

But when it comes to the inside of an LCD display or toner cartridge mechanics, which this book will teach you everything about, reading is gruesome. 

That being said, eat the frog first as Mark Twain said. Nothing beats pen and paper as a first resource. 

Rote memorization isn't replaced by hands-on practice, it's supplemented by it. And if you're going to power through a whole ton of information, do it in multiple formats...

### Professor Messer's playlists

...And that's where Messer comes in. The book could have used more images. Messer shows you video of what a RAM replacement looks like, for example. 

After you've read a dozen paragraphs describing what it's like. 

And the videos hammer home points you may have missed in the book.

### The official CompTIA A+ exam objectives

While watching the Messer videos, I went through the objectives for the first time and recognized everything in this document is word for word in the video series. 

So this document is Professor Messer's script and to me it's a transcript. 

The way the videos sealed in the information from the book, the objectives sealed in the information from the videos. 

I turned the objectives into an outline, writing notes as I was watching the videos. But the notes are incomplete because I started them halfway through. 

And because I was cramming I also powered through the second half of the 1002 playlist without taking notes. 12 hours before the 1002 exam.

### [Thanh Hung's free iPhone app with practice questions](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/comptia-a-exam-training/id1501304886)

Now that we rote memorized (kind of), we get hands on.

I mean, you could have installed a virtual machine and typed in the command line while you were watching Messer, but did you?

The book had a link to a free practice test for both the 1001 and 1002 on this website. 

And that's it! These last two resources are what I went through twice the final hours before the 1002, effectively turning hands-on back into rote memorization. 

If I was more disciplined I would have also gone through the Udemy courses by Mike Meyers and Jason Dion that I bought. Meyers is funny.
