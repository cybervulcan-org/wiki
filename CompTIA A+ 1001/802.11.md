# 802.11

Standard | Frequency | Streams
-- | - | - 
802.11a | 5 GHz | N/a
802.11b | 2.4 GHz | N/a
802.11g | 2.4 GHz | N/a
802.11n | 2.4 / 5 GHz | 4 MIMO 
802.11ac | 5 GHz | 8 MU-MIMO

### Backwards compatibility
- a standard is backwards compatible with another if both are in the same band
- so 802.11ac is backwards compatible with 802.11a and 802.11n over the 5 GHz band

### MIMO
The jump from 54 to 600 Mbps is thanks to MIMO.
