# Cybervulcan's Wiki  ~~Manual  Handbook  Guide  Outline  Knowledge base~~

Dear fellow Tech,

Hello! I am an entry-level tech support. 
These are the notes I made to become CompTIA A+ certified. 
They are mostly an organized transcription of Professor Messer's videos. 
I had the idea that it would be better to have a ton of bite-sized articles instead of a few articles that each weigh a ton. 
Also, I didn't know what I was doing for most of the 1001 notes, and I was cramming for the 1002 so the second half is missing. 
But as I turn this outline into a reference manual to use on the job, I will complete the missing info and make this look good. 

The beauty of organized markdown files is that they're just interlinked concept bubbles. Your own personal Google. An index. A web.
I hope this resource helps you as a student or professional. 
I recommend you open this repo in Obsidian. 
The READMEs tie everything together by linking to each article, like a Table of Contents. 

Before tech support, I was already learning about pentesting and web app bug bounties, so I know about ports and commands. 
That's why it helps me to have just a page listing all the ports, a folder listing all the commands. 
Another reason why I took more notes on the 1002 is because it's Windows-focused. I come from macOS and know nothing about Windows. 

Best of luck on your journey,

Cybervulcan
