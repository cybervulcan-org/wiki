# Cybervulcan's Wiki

Dear fellow Tech,

Hello! I am an entry-level tech support. These are the notes I made to become CompTIA A+ certified. Edit: I am now studying for the Network+ as you can see. 

To get the most important info out of the way: *I recommend you open this repo in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)* or some other markdown editor that lets you easily see the links, or *mentions*, between different pages. 

I'm chasing the idea of having a ton of bite-sized articles instead of a few articles that each weigh a ton. This way I can sort of build a web or index—which is what Google is—of small, [interlinked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h-seEowtDw) concepts. No information is repeated because if I have to mention a small topic that there's already a page on, I can just link to that page. 

In the same way, a README binds all the pages together and acts like a table of contents. If you don't know, I have one file in each exam folder titled README.md so that Github renders these files in the folder view. These are markdown versions of the exam objectives which I've populated with links to my notes for each bullet point. 

My intention is for this resource to help you whether you are a student or a professional. Good luck and have fun on your journey!

P.S. Some more info about this wiki: 

I'm mainly transcribing [Professor Messer's videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/professormesser/playlists) because he tells you exactly what you need to know. I'm going to admit I didn't know what I was doing for most of the 1001 notes and I was cramming for the 1002 so the second half is missing... But as I turn these outlines into a reference manual to use on the job, I will complete the missing info and make this look good. 

Before tech support, I was already learning about pentesting and web app bug bounties, so I know about ports and commands. That's why it helps me to have just a page listing all the ports, a folder listing all the commands. Another reason why I took more notes on the 1002 is because it's Windows-focused. I come from macOS and know nothing about Windows.
